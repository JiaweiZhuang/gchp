%\subsection{Description}
\label{sec:Tracing}

{\em Tracing} is a special kind of logging in which information about
a program's execution is recorded so that it can later be analyzed. Trace
analysis can be used to understand what happened during a program's
execution and is often used for diagnosing problems, debugging, and
performance analysis.

ESMF has a built-in tracing capability that records events into special
binary log files.  Unlike log files written by the {\tt ESMF\_Log} class,
which are primarily for human consumption (see Section \ref{sec:Log}),
the trace output files are
recorded in a compact binary representation and are processed by tools
to produce various analyses. ESMF event streams are recorded in the
\htmladdnormallink{Common Trace Format}{http://diamon.org/ctf/} (CTF).
CTF traces include one or more event streams,
as well as a metadata file describing the events in the streams.

Several tools are available for reading in the CTF traces output by ESMF.
Of the tools listed below, the first one is designed specifically for
analyzing ESMF applications and the second two are general purpose tools
for working with all CTF traces.
\begin{itemize}
\item \htmladdnormallink{Cupid}{https://earthsystemcog.org/projects/cupid/}
  is a plugin for the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment
  that can read and analyze ESMF traces.
\item \htmladdnormallink{TraceCompass}{http://tracecompass.org/}
  is a general purpose tool for reading, analyzing, and visualizing traces.
\item \htmladdnormallink{Babeltrace}{http://www.efficios.com/babeltrace}
  is a command-line tool and library for trace conversion
  that can read and write CTF traces. Python bindings are available
  to open CTF traces are iterate through events.  
\end{itemize}

Events that can be captured by the ESMF tracer include the following. Events
are recorded with a high-precision timestamp to allow timing analyses.
\begin{description}
\item [phase\_enter] indicates entry into an initialize, run, or finalize ESMF component routine
\item [phase\_exit] indicates exit from an initialize, run, or finalize ESMF component routine
\item [region\_enter] indicates entry into a user-defined code region
\item [region\_exit] indicates exit from a user-defined code region
\item [mem] records current memory usage information
\end{description}

The following table lists important environment variables that control
aspects of ESMF tracing.
